    <h3> Projects</h3>
    <p>Below are some of the projects I have produced while expanding my knowledge in software development. Currently, I am working on a certificate in frontend development with <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">freecodecamp.org</a>. The program is roughly 400 hours covering HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, JQuery, Javascript, JSON, Ajax, and algorithm scripting.</p>
